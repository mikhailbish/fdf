validate file contents - make sure that the grid is rectangular, consider the comma separated values in maps like pyramide.fdf, what should they mean

parse coordinates from file (into a 2d matrix in a correct projection, use the proximity of points along the XY-axis to identify which pairs should be connected)

Tasks:

-	move parsing out of the hook (done?)
-	reorganize code into more managable components, separate files:
	1.1	math utils (vector matrix calculations)
	1.2	mlx utils
	1.3	errors and exits
	1.4	parsing
	1.5	validation
-	find the right way to draw a line between points, make sure the points themselves are drawn, accounting for error margins
	-	add brasenham
start point > make sure every line is drawn wip
-	add colors
	parsing
-	add gradient
	putline logic
-	add scaling (determine the highest and lowest x and y values)
-	parse colors as well as points
-	scaling calculations and centering
	either use second coords matrix or learn to calculate the max possible fixing scale
-	implement function pointers to work with coordinates
-	fix the bug where some points disappear
	find the way to test that each possible line would be drawn correctly, without points being skipped 
-	make the programm display lines once, unless something changes //DONE, painted struct member
