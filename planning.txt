validate file contents - make sure that the grid is rectangular, consider the comma separated values in maps like pyramide.fdf, what should they mean

parse coordinates from file (into a 2d matrix in a correct projection, use the proximity of points along the XY-axis to identify which pairs should be connected)

Tasks:

-	move parsing out of the hook (done?)
-	reorganize code into more managable components, separate files:
	1.1	math utils (vector matrix calculations)
	1.2	mlx utils
	1.3	errors and exits
	1.4	parsing
	1.5	validation
-	putlines
-	handle if map doesn't exist										done
	https://digitalbunker.dev/bresenhams-line-algorithm/
	
-	add colors												done
	parsing													done
	add logic to take colors from point struct
	optionally comes after z, separated by comma
-	add gradient
	yellow spots in Julia? possibly some red -> white gradient
	putline logic
-	add scaling (determine the highest and lowest x and y values)
-	scaling calculations and centering									PRIORITY
	rethink parsing to adapt to put_pixel logic, so that, I would not need to make image->height - y operation
-	implement function pointers to work with coordinates
-	make the program display lines once, unless something changes 						done, painted struct member introduced
	mlx_delete_image
	mlx_resize_image
	^ Explore others
-	clipping algorythm
	necessary for the zoom feature
