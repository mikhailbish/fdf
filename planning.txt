validate file contents - make sure that the grid is rectangular, consider the comma separated values in maps like pyramide.fdf, what should they mean

parse coordinates from file (into a 2d matrix in a correct projection, use the proximity of points along the XY-axis to identify which pairs should be connected)

Tasks:

-	move parsing out of the hook (done?)
-	reorganize code into more managable components, separate files:
	1.1	math utils (vector matrix calculations)
	1.2	mlx utils
	1.3	errors and exits
	1.4	parsing
	1.5	validation
-	putlines
	elem-col map has an extra line coming to the height 20 point. Is it a bug or am I missing something? URGENT
-	handle if map doesn't exist
-	find the right way to draw a line between points, make sure the points themselves are drawn, accounting for error margins
	-	add brasenham				WIP

-	add colors					done, needs testing
	parsing						done, needs testing
	add logic to take colors from point struct
	optionally comes after z, separated by comma
-	add gradient
	putline logic
-	add scaling (determine the highest and lowest x and y values)
-	scaling calculations and centering PRIORITY
	either use second coords matrix or learn to calculate the max possible fixing scale
-	implement function pointers to work with coordinates
-	make the program display lines once, unless something changes //DONE, painted struct member
	mlx_delete_image
	mlx_resize_image
	^ Explore others
-	clipping algorythm
